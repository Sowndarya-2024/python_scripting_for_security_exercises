# Type Casting Exercise

a = 7

# 1. print the type of the variable
print(type(a))
#   Convert integer variable to float and confirm the type cast worked (print it out)
b=float(a)
print(b)

# 2. Now, Convert your float variable to string and print out the type
c=string(b)
print(c)


# 3. Finally, Convert your string variable back to integer and print it out (the type)
print(int(c))
